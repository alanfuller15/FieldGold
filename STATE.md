# FieldGold — migration state

Last updated: 2026-07-28 (reconciliation pass — every row below re-checked
against the tree, not carried forward from the previous version)

## Active phase

**Phase 0 — Capacitor shell**

Goal: FieldGold launches from a real app icon on Alan's iPhone, with zero
changes to app code.

## Status

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| Capacitor installed | not started — no `package.json`, no `node_modules/`, no `capacitor.config.*` in the tree [self-tested] 2026-07-28 |
| `capacitor.config` webDir confirmed | **decided — `"docs"`. Contingency discharged: `docs/` exists and holds only web assets** |
| Stage maps in `webDir` — ship or exclude | **decided 2026-07-28 — SHIP.** `webDir` is all of `docs/`. See the decision section for what this accepts |
| iOS platform added | not started — no `ios/` directory [self-tested] 2026-07-28 |
| Builds in Xcode | not started |
| Signing configured | not started |
| Installed on device | not started |
| Launches and renders | not started |

## Verified facts

<!-- Append only. Each entry: claim + tier + date. -->
<!-- Example: Apple Developer Program enrolled [externally-verified] 2026-07-26 -->

- SessionStart hook fires and injects STATE.md [externally-verified] 2026-07-25
- Every web asset lives under `docs/`; `tests/` and `tools/` remain at the repo
  root. 20 tracked files under `docs/`, none outside it that the app serves
  [self-tested] 2026-07-28
- All twelve suites pass against the moved tree. `bash .claude/verify.sh` →
  "VERIFY PASSED — all 12 suites ran and passed" [self-tested] 2026-07-28
- 489 assertions, re-counted by running each suite and reading its own total:
  30/50 node; 30, 31, 39, 48, 29, 25, 15, 109, 68, 15 python. Identical to the
  2026-07-26 measurement recorded in CLAUDE.md [self-tested] 2026-07-28
- GitHub Pages source is branch `main`, path `/docs`, and
  `pages/builds/latest.commit` is `ac215fd` — equal to `origin/main` HEAD, so
  the live bytes are this commit's and not an earlier build's [fetched]
  2026-07-28
- Live site serves the moved tree: `index.html`, `map.html`,
  `fieldgold-data.js`, `vendor/leaflet/leaflet.js` and `stage3_map.html` all
  200, byte counts equal to the local files, and `VISION_PROMPT` /
  "Scan documented gold occurrences" present in the served HTML [fetched]
  2026-07-28
- Nothing in the shipped app pages links to a stage map — zero matches for
  `stage[0-9]` across `index.html`, `map.html`, `bench_hunter.html`,
  `creek_manual.html`, `load_rem_benches.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest.json`. All
  five carry the ARCHIVED BUILD STAGE banner [self-tested] 2026-07-28
- Vendored `leaflet.css` still hashes to the published SRI — 661 CRLF, 0 bare
  LF, in both worktree and stored blob [self-tested] 2026-07-28

## Decisions made

- **`webDir` is `"docs"`.** As of Phase 0a this is usable: `docs/` exists,
  holds only web assets, and GitHub Pages serves branch `main` at path
  `/docs`. The public URL is unchanged — Pages maps `docs/` onto the site
  root, which the live check on 2026-07-28 confirmed.

  *(This entry previously read "there is no `docs/` directory yet — so this
  value is not usable until Phase 0a moves the web assets." That was true when
  written and stopped being true on 2026-07-27.)*

  `"."` was rejected. `webDir` is the directory Capacitor copies into the
  native bundle, and at the repo root that sweeps `ios/`, `.git/`, `.claude/`,
  the `.0009-backup-*` directories, `tests/` and `tools/` into the app.

## Phase 0 — DECIDED 2026-07-28: `webDir` ships the stage maps

**Decision: ship them. `webDir` stays `"docs"` — the whole directory, no
exclusions, no prune.** Made by Alan 2026-07-28. The reasoning, the cost this
accepts, and the follow-on filed for Phase 1 are all below. Read the cost
section before you decide this was free.

### Why ship

Phase 0's hard rule is **change no app code**, and its purpose is to isolate
Apple-toolchain friction from everything else. Adding a bundle-prune mechanism
to this phase means that when something fails, the failure could be Capacitor
or it could be the prune — and Phase 0 exists precisely so that question has
one possible answer.

The mitigation being relied on is the banner plus zero inbound links. That is
**the same mitigation already considered adequate on the public site**, which
serves these five pages today at `alanfuller15.github.io/FieldGold/`.

### What this decision ACCEPTS

Recorded plainly so this is not read back as a null result. It is not.

**For the duration of Phase 0, a page that can mislead is reachable by typed
URL on a phone in terrain.** A stage map looks like FieldGold, carries no
land-status layer, and draws nothing. A person who reaches one cannot tell it
from the real map failing. That is a real cost, accepted deliberately, in
exchange for a clean answer to "did the toolchain work" on the first device
install.

It is bounded by three things and by nothing else: the red ARCHIVED BUILD
STAGE banner on all five, zero inbound links from any shipped app page, and
the fact that reaching one requires typing a URL that nothing in the app
displays. If any of those three stops being true, this decision must be
revisited rather than inherited.

### Background

Phase 0a **moved** `stage1_map_test.html` … `stage5_map.html` into `docs/`
along with every other web asset, because they are published today and three
suites load them over HTTP. They now sit inside `webDir`, which means that on
today's configuration **they will ship inside the iOS bundle.**

CLAUDE.md deliberately keeps them out of the `sw.js` SHELL. The reasoning
there: a cached stage map looks like FieldGold, carries no land-status layer,
and shows nothing at all — a browser offline error is the more honest outcome.
`tests/test_stage_maps.py` asserts their absence from SHELL so a future
"helpful" addition trips a test.

Bundling them reintroduces that risk by a different route. The bundle is not
the service worker cache — the mechanism is different and the SHELL assertion
still holds — but a person who reaches one of these pages on a phone cannot
tell the difference. They carry a red ARCHIVED BUILD STAGE banner, and nothing
in the app links to them. That is the mitigation that exists today. It was
written for a browser bookmark, not for a page shipped inside an app icon.

Both halves of that mitigation re-verified against the tree 2026-07-28
[self-tested]: all five files contain `ARCHIVED BUILD STAGE`, and `stage[0-9]`
has **zero** matches across `index.html`, `map.html`, `bench_hunter.html`,
`creek_manual.html`, `load_rem_benches.html`, `sw.js` and `manifest.json` —
reachable by typed URL only. `tests/test_stage_maps.py` still asserts their
absence from the `sw.js` SHELL, and `tests/test_panel_reachability.py` still
covers all five, so both remain load-bearing whichever way the decision goes.

The branch not taken was to exclude them from `webDir`. That option is not
discarded — it moves to Phase 1 as its own item, below. See "Phase 1 — enforce
the bundle/Pages divergence".

Do not resolve this by quietly deleting the stage maps. They are the build
history of `map.html` and CLAUDE.md keeps them on purpose.

## Phase 0a — move web assets to docs/ — **COMPLETE 2026-07-27**

A prerequisite that Phase 0 uncovered. Not in the original 0-4 plan.

Phase 0 could not set a safe `webDir` until the web assets sat in a directory
that contains only web assets. Phase 0a did that move and nothing else.

| Step | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Move web assets into `docs/` | **done** — `11e8dcf`, pure renames | 20 tracked files under `docs/` [self-tested] 2026-07-28 |
| Flip Pages source `/` -> `/docs` | **done** | `pages.source` = `{branch: main, path: /docs}` [fetched] 2026-07-28 |
| Repoint test suites at the new web root | **done** — `2bcc960` | all 10 python suites define `REPO` then `ROOT = REPO / "docs"`; both `.js` suites join `'docs'`; two suites (`test_state_claims.py`, `test_seed_drift.py`) carry a genuine REPO/WEB split as predicted [self-tested] 2026-07-28 |
| Repoint `tools/build_loader.py` | **done** — `2bcc960` | `SRC`/`DST`/`DATA_JS` all under `_WEB` [self-tested] 2026-07-28 |
| Full suite green | **done** | `bash .claude/verify.sh` → all 12 ran and passed; 489 assertions [self-tested] 2026-07-28 |

Deploy verified beyond the status field, per CLAUDE.md's rule that a `built`
status can name an earlier commit: `pages/builds/latest.commit` = `ac215fd` =
`origin/main` HEAD, and the served assets match the local bytes with content
greps hitting [fetched] 2026-07-28.

Two follow-ons landed after the move and are also complete: `docs/.nojekyll`
(`53edb99`), and `ac215fd` which **retracted** that commit's stated reason —
the claim that Jekyll's default excludes would drop `vendor/` was untested and
wrong. The file stays for determinism; the justification was corrected rather
than the file removed.

Retained below for history — this was the pre-move inventory, and every item on
it was addressed by `2bcc960`. Kept because it records *why* two suites needed a
REPO/WEB split rather than a one-line constant change, which is not obvious from
the diff.

Known to break on the move (inspected 2026-07-26, no changes made):

- All 10 Python suites compute `ROOT = __file__.parent.parent` and serve it as
  the HTTP document root, then fetch `/map.html`, `/index.html`,
  `/load_rem_benches.html`. Those 404.
- ~17 direct `ROOT / "<file>"` joins across 8 suites — the mutation-injection
  targets. A mutant that cannot find its file aborts exit 2 rather than
  reporting a false pass.
- Both `.js` suites: `path.join(path.dirname(__dirname), 'fieldgold-data.js')`.
- `tools/build_loader.py` `_ROOT` — both `SRC`/`DST` and `DATA_JS` writes.
- `tests/test_seed_drift.py` copies those two files plus the generator by
  `ROOT/name`.
- `tests/test_state_claims.py:480` needs **both** roots in one tree: it
  copytrees the root and runs `tools/build_loader.py` inside it. This one
  needs a genuine `REPO` / `WEB` split, not a one-line constant change.

Not affected: in-app links, `manifest.json` (`start_url` and `scope` are
relative), the `sw.js` SHELL (all `./`-relative), and the service worker
registration. Served URLs are identical after the move, so the move alone
does not require a cache version bump.

## Phase 1 — enforce the bundle/Pages divergence

**Filed 2026-07-28, not started. This is an item, not a note.** It is the
branch Phase 0 did not take, deferred with a reason rather than dropped.

Excluding the stage maps from the iOS bundle means **`webDir` stops being "the
directory Pages serves"**. Once those two trees are allowed to differ, nothing
in this repo currently notices if they differ in some *other* way — a file
dropped from the bundle by accident reads exactly like a file excluded on
purpose. So the work is two parts and neither is optional:

1. **A mechanism** — a copy step or a post-`sync` prune. `webDir` cannot simply
   be repointed at a subdirectory, because the stage maps must keep being
   served by Pages and keep being loadable over HTTP by
   `tests/test_stage_maps.py`, `tests/test_panel_reachability.py` and the other
   suites that fetch them.
2. **A test asserting the bundle and the Pages tree diverge exactly as intended
   and no further** — enumerating both trees and requiring the difference to be
   precisely the five stage maps. Without this, the mechanism is unguarded and
   the first silent drop ships.

**Untested here:** Capacitor's ignore behaviour for `webDir` contents. Whether
`cap copy` honours any exclusion mechanism at all was not verified on this
machine, and the plan above assumes it may not. Establish that before designing
around it.

**Why Phase 1 is the right home.** Phase 1 consolidates the scattered HTML into
one routed app. That is the change which legitimately decides what is
reachable — reachability becomes a property of the router rather than of which
files happen to sit in a directory. Bolting an exclusion onto the wrapper
answers the same question in a weaker place.

Until this lands, the accepted cost recorded under the Phase 0 decision stands.

## Open decisions

- Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) vs free 7-day provisioning.
  Free tier requires re-signing weekly — likely unworkable for field use.
  **Not yet decided.**

## Deliberately not built yet

These were considered and deferred. Do not start them without Alan saying so.

- MCP verification server (ARDF / BLM / USGS)
- iOS build automation in CI
- Any Phase 1-4 work

## Next action

**Install Capacitor.** Phase 0a is done, `webDir` is `"docs"` and usable, and
the stage-map question that was gating it is decided (ship). Nothing blocks
runbook steps 2–4 — `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli`, `cap init`,
`cap add ios`, `cap sync`, `cap open ios`.

**Step 5, signing, is blocked and only step 5.** The Apple Developer Program
vs free-provisioning decision is Alan's and has not been made; see Open
decisions. Steps 2–4 can be run and verified without it, so the block does not
reach backwards. Do not pick a tier to keep moving.

The procedure for the Capacitor half is
**`.claude/skills/phase-0-shell/SKILL.md`** — Capacitor init, `cap add ios`,
signing, provisioning, first device install. That file is how; this file is
how far. Update the tables above as its steps land, and record the tier
([self-tested] / [fetched] / [externally-verified]) under Verified facts.
Phase 0a had no runbook — the breakage inventory above was what there was, and
it is now closed history.
